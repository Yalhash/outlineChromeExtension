# outlineChromeExtension
A chrome extention that I made because I was annoyed by the constant paywalls on articles from websites I don't visit often. It takes the current page you are on and opens it in outline which more often than not can open the full article for you. To install it just clone this repository into a folder go into chrome>more tools>Extensions and turn on developer mode. After that click the "Load unpacked" button and choose the folder with this repository in it
